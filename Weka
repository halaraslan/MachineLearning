Dataset: The “Dataset_spam” folder contains two subfolders: “email” and “spam”. Each of these subfolders contains 481 email files and 481 spam files. 
Task: Develop the analysis report as described below and submit the report: As demonstrated and discussed, the development of NASA’s patent-classifier for the fifteen-class classification problem, here similarly for the assignments, we will need to do the following steps and develop the analysis report: 
i)	Given the dataset, use Weka’s TextDirectoryLoader to build up the initial ARFF file, which will contain the email-spam-text as strings and the output class {email,spam}. Add the initial class distribution in the report. Also, report the required average conversion time in this step, describing how you obtained the average conversion time. 
ii)	Convert the text-string to the most useful vector using Weka’s unsupervised filtering tool: StringToWordVector. Report the parameters you have chosen and explain their roles and justify your selections. Also, report how many words you have collected in this step. 
iii)	Using Weka’s supervised filter, apply ‘infoGainAttributeEval’ with ‘Ranker’ having threshold value set to 0.0. Now, report the total words remains for classification and report the first 10 words with their information-gain values. 
iv)	Run 10 different classifiers and measure their performances using 10 FCV. Report all their performances (accuracy in %) including the confusion matrices. You must include the Naïve-Bayes approach as one of the 10 classifiers. 
v)	Report the best method with its parameter(s) you have found, including the performance-evaluation matrices. Explain why do you think your selected top method is the best method out of the 10 methods you tried.
